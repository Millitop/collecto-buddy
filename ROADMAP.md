# CollectorAI Development Roadmap
*MVP â†’ Pro progression over 12 weeks*

## Current Status: V1.5 (Ahead of Schedule!)
We've successfully implemented most V1 features and several V2 components.

## ðŸ“± V1 (Weeks 1-4): MVP Foundation
**Target: Core scanning and collection features**

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Camera integration (Capacitor)
- [x] On-device classification (HuggingFace Transformers)
- [x] Multi-category support (cards, porcelain, coins, stamps, toys)
- [x] Database-backed collection management
- [x] Basic price estimation system
- [x] User authentication & profiles
- [x] Mobile-first responsive design

### ðŸ”§ In Progress
- [ ] **OCR Integration** - Complete ML Kit/Tesseract implementation
  - Text extraction from objects
  - Serial numbers, signatures, stamps
  - Integration with classification pipeline

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- [ ] 500+ successful scans
- [ ] 85%+ classification accuracy
- [ ] <2s scan-to-result time

---

## ðŸš€ V2 (Weeks 5-8): Enhanced Intelligence
**Target: Professional-grade analysis and workflow**

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Batch scanning mode (20+ objects)
- [x] Collection export framework
- [x] User feedback system structure

### ðŸ”§ Priority Tasks
1. **Advanced Condition Grading**
   ```typescript
   // Implement specialized grading for each category
   - Cards: Centering, corners, edges, surface
   - Porcelain: Chips, cracks, staining, crazing
   - Coins: Wear patterns, luster, scratches
   ```

2. **Porcelain Stamp Recognition**
   - Bottom stamp detection and reading
   - Manufacturer database integration
   - Year/pattern matching

3. **Enhanced Export System**
   - PDF collection reports
   - Professional appraisal formats
   - Insurance documentation

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- [ ] 95%+ condition accuracy for cards
- [ ] 80%+ stamp recognition rate
- [ ] Export adoption >30%

## ðŸ”¥ V3 (Weeks 9-12): Professional Platform
**Target: Complete collector ecosystem**

### ðŸŽ¯ Major Features

1. **Multi-Domain Mastery**
   - Specialized algorithms per category
   - Domain-specific authenticity checks
   - Expert-level variant recognition

2. **Market Intelligence**
   ```typescript
   // Price alert system
   interface PriceAlert {
     item_id: string;
     target_price: number;
     frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly';
     notifications: boolean;
   }
   ```

3. **Professional Sharing**
   - Branded PDF collection reports
   - Insurance documentation
   - Social sharing with privacy controls

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics
- [ ] Support 5+ collectible domains
- [ ] 1000+ active price alerts
- [ ] 50%+ users sharing collections
